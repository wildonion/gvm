concepts:
    shared ownership, 
    interior mutability, 
    weak, and strong references

Shared ownership
    While the children are owned by the struct, it is necessary to provide access to these 
    children node to other code that use this tree data structure. Moving these references 
    out of the tree isn’t desirable. And cloning the entire node before moving it out of the 
    tree isn’t optimal either. This is where shared onwnership comes into play. In order to 
    do that, we wrap the underlying node in a Rc. This is a reference counted pointer. However, 
    that isn’t enough, since once we pass a (shared) reference to other code (that is using 
        this tree), we need to provide the ability to mutate what is inside the node itself, 
        which leads us to interior mutability.
Interior mutability
    Once a reference (that allows for shared ownership) of a node is passed to code 
    using the tree, it becomes necessary to allow modifications to the underlying node 
    itself. This requires us to use interior mutability by wrapping the node in a 
    RefCell. Which is then wrapped in the Rc that we use to share ownership. Combining 
    these two together gets us to where we need to be.

 | | +- value: T ---------------------------------------+

 |                                                |
 |                 This describes a non-ownership relationship.
 |                 When a node is dropped, its parent will not be dropped.
 |
 +---- children: RwLock<Vec<Child<T>>> ---+
                                          |
                This describes an ownership relationship.
                When a node is dropped its children will be dropped as well.


1 - When a node is dropped, its children will be dropped as well (since it owns them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a strong reference.

2 - However, the parent should not be dropped (since it does not own them). 
    We represent this relationship w/ a weak reference.

/* 
    thread safe tree using Arc and tokio::sync::Mutex to create DOM and redux like system 
    note that a node data can be either a parent or a child node, if it's a parent node 
    then all its `children` must be in form Arc<NodeData<T>> or a strong reference to all 
    children and if it's a child node then its `parent` field must be in form Weak<NodeData<T>>
    or a weak reference to its parent
    parent points to children in a strong way since if a parent want to be removed all its 
    children or strong references must be removed and reaches zero first then the parent can be 
    dropped and child points to parent in a weak way since by dropping a child the parent shouldn’t 
    be dropped which is the nature of weak reference since the type can be dropped even there are 
    multiple weak references are pointing to the type, but in strong case first all the pointers 
    and references came to the type must be dropped and reach zero count then the type itself can 
    be dropped after that easily.
    any instance of NodeData, if it's a child node instance then the pointer to the parent field must be weak
    if it's a parent node instance then the pointer to the child must be strong
