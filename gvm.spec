never return poiner from method just return vec or string but pass them in slice form to not to lose 
their ownerhsip cause can't return ref to a data owned by the method we have to either ret the type in 
its slice form with valid lifetime or return it as self.field cause self has longer lifetime also the 
memory allocation process in rust depends on the types' lifetimes means that every type in rust has a 
valid lifetime and as soon as the type gets moved into other scopes or threads or methods its lifetime 
will be dropped from the ram and will be owned by that scope in other words we can't move out of a type
or deref it if it's behind a shared ref or pointer also we can't have a type in two scopes at the same time
without passing a reference or a clone of that into the second scopes, we should either clone the type or 
borrow it and pass one of these to the second scope cause rust doesn't have gc to track the references 
came to the type and use that to destroy the type when it reaches the zero instead it's using lifetime 
conceptes which in single thread contexts we can use Rc to count the references of a type shared between 
scopes but in multithread contexts we must use Arc and Mutex or RwLock to share the ownership of the type 
between threads without having race conditions and deadlocks although rust forces us to use every type only 
once during the whole lifetime of the app which this manner prevents us from allocating extra space on the 
ram and deadlocks situation since the concept of ownership and borrowing is about sharing a type with 
reference or cloning to not to lose its ownership in future scopes, if we allocate something in a scope we 
can't move it out of that cause its being used inside that scopes, we have to borrow it or clone it or convert 
it to its owned type if it's a sliced form or pointer of a type, slices are just a representation of dynamic 
types with no dynamic allocation feature.

this is lle parallel based vm and game engine graph like DOM, an state manager 
like yew and redux with tree walking using (shared ref and mutably) using rc and 
arc weak and strong ref counting, shared ownership and interior mutability, based on 
actor and graph concepts so we have followers weighted tree to understand the 
relationship between peers to suggests events in a graph virtual machine by using 

lazy static global, mutexed, rwlocked, mpsc, rusty ltg pointers, slices, codec hash hex and file bytes,
ret &'validlifetime ref and trait as param like -> impl Trait as type from method and use them in method 
param like param: impl Trait from method also can't move type if it's behind pointer send sync static, 
shared ownership using Mutex and RwLock and RefCell, GlobalAlloc arena referene counting using Rc Arc, Box 
leaking, Pin, &mut type, cap, length, macros, Cow, Borrowed, ToOwned, Deref, &mut (ast, token stream), 
std::mem, generic, lifetimes, closures, traits, pointers and bytecode, .so and .elf bpf, wasm, bytes and 
hex serding and codec ops using borsh and serde, async trait and associative bounding Trait::method(): Send and 
?async and ?const, gen block, r3bl_rs_utils crate, read/write io traits, Box<dyn Trait>, as_ref(), unwrap(), clone() 
and Box stores data on the heap and contains an smart pointer with a valid lifetime to the underlying type, 
also the size of the boxed type is the size of the type itself, the value of the box can be caught 
by dereferencing the box

every type has its own lifetime and if it goes out of scope it'll be dropped from the ram and we can 
either borrow it or clone it since rust dones't have gc instead it has rc, refcell for single thread 
and arc and mutex for multithread reference counting and borrowing based on these concetps share ownership 
between threads using Arc by borrowing the ownership using pointers like & clone share ownership between 
scopes using Rc by  borrwoing the ownership using pointers like & and clone Rc is not safe to be used between 
threads but Arc can be used to share the type between multiple threads safely without having race conditions, 
also if we want to mutate an immutable type at runtime we must use RefCell which is a single threaded smart 
pointer and for mutating type between multiple threads we must use Mutex or RwLock to avoid deadlocks situations.

Single Thread    Multithread             Usage
Rc               --> Arc                 make the type shareable between scopes and threads
RefCell          --> RwLock || Mutex     make the type mutably safe at runtime in scopes and threads

everytime we try to move type betweeen scopes and threads without losing ownership we're taking a reference to that thread so:
    share and mutate the actual type using its &mut pointer in a single thread scope
    share and mutate the actual type using its Arc<RwLock<Type>> pointer in a multithread scope
