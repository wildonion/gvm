The primary difference between joining on a thread and running it in the background (e.g., using `tokio::spawn` in asynchronous Rust) lies in how they handle concurrency and task completion.

### Joining on a Thread
In Rust, joining on a thread means waiting for that thread to finish its execution. This is typically done using `std::thread::join`.

- **Blocking**: When you call `join` on a thread, the current thread will block until the joined thread has finished executing. This means that no further progress can be made by the current thread until the joined thread completes.
- **Use Case**: This is useful when you need to ensure that a thread's task is completed before proceeding, such as when aggregating results from multiple threads or ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up.

Example:
```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        // Some work in a separate thread
        println!("Thread is running");
    });

    // Wait for the thread to finish
    handle.join().unwrap();
    println!("Thread has finished");
}
```

In this example, the main thread waits for the spawned thread to complete before printing the final message.

### Running a Task in the Background with `tokio::spawn`
In asynchronous Rust with Tokio, `tokio::spawn` is used to run an asynchronous task in the background. This allows the task to run concurrently with other tasks without blocking the main thread or executor.

- **Non-blocking**: When you use `tokio::spawn`, the task runs in the background, and the function call returns immediately. The spawned task runs concurrently with other tasks managed by the Tokio runtime, and you can continue executing other code without waiting for the task to complete.
- **Use Case**: This is useful for performing asynchronous operations that can run independently, such as network requests, I/O operations, or background computations.

Example:
```rust
use tokio::task;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let handle = task::spawn(async {
        // Some asynchronous work
        println!("Task is running");
    });

    // The main task can continue running concurrently
    println!("Main task continues running");

    // Await the spawned task to ensure it completes
    handle.await.unwrap();
    println!("Task has finished");
}
```

In this example, the main task prints a message and continues running concurrently with the spawned task. The main task then awaits the spawned task's completion at a later point, allowing for non-blocking concurrency.

### Key Differences

1. **Blocking vs. Non-blocking**:
   - `std::thread::join`: Blocks the current thread until the joined thread finishes.
   - `tokio::spawn`: Runs the task in the background without blocking, allowing other tasks to progress concurrently.

2. **Use Case**:
   - `std::thread::join`: Suitable for synchronous, blocking code where threads need to be synchronized.
   - `tokio::spawn`: Suitable for asynchronous, non-blocking code where tasks can run concurrently under the Tokio runtime.

3. **Concurrency Model**:
   - `std::thread::join`: Works in a multi-threaded environment where each thread can block independently.
   - `tokio::spawn`: Works in an asynchronous environment where tasks are scheduled and run by the Tokio runtime, which efficiently handles many tasks concurrently without blocking threads.

### Conclusion
Choosing between joining on a thread and running a task in the background with `tokio::spawn` depends on the concurrency model of your application. For synchronous, blocking tasks, `std::thread::join` is appropriate. For asynchronous, non-blocking tasks, `tokio::spawn` allows you to leverage Tokio's concurrency model effectively.
