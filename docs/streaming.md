> Comprehensive Guide to Choose the Most Appropriate Broker

we'll walk through some steps to see the comparisons between RMQ and Kafka. However there are some notable things need to be mentioned in here such that if we need high latency, hight throughput, distributed streaming and trustable retaining mechanism for messages after consuming them by consumers it's good to go with **Kafka** other than that for handling complex message routing patterns, low latency, low throughput fast message deletion process from the queue after consuming would be better option to go with **RMQ**.  

# Design 1 (Celery + RMQ + ShortPolling)

In this scenario, where we have a system using HTTP requests to receive prediction requests, and we send those requests to an AI service that uses **Celery** for task queuing, then sends a **job ID** to the client for polling, the architecture could benefit from optimizations. Whether it's good to replace the current system with **RabbitMQ (RMQ)** or **Kafka** depends on a few factors.

### **Current System Summary**:

1. **HTTP Requests**: The client sends a request to the AI service for predictions.
2. **Celery**: The AI service queues tasks using Celery, which is typically backed by a message broker (RabbitMQ in this case).
3. **Job ID + Polling**: The client is short-polling the system using the job ID to check if the prediction task is complete.

### **Potential Problems with the Current Setup**:

1. **Short Polling Overhead**: the client is repeatedly hitting the server to check if the result is ready. This can add unnecessary load to the system and increase latency for the client if the response isn’t ready immediately.
2. **Task Queuing**: Celery typically uses RabbitMQ as its broker to handle task queues. However, if we are looking for higher throughput, more durability, or real-time stream processing, this might not be the most optimal for large-scale use cases.

# Design 2 (Kafka Only):

We **can replace the HTTP-based communication** (both the initial prediction request and the short polling) with **Kafka** to create a more streamlined, event-driven architecture. This will remove the need for HTTP, Celery, and RabbitMQ for queuing and task distribution. Here’s how this setup could work using Kafka:

### **1. Client Sends Request via Kafka (Instead of HTTP)**

- **Current State**: The client sends an HTTP request to the AI service and receives a `jobId` in return.
- **With Kafka**: Instead of sending an HTTP request, the client **produces a message** to a Kafka topic (e.g., `prediction_requests`). This message would contain all the necessary data for the prediction request.

### **2. AI Service Subscribes to Kafka Topic**

- The **AI service** (which replaces Celery and RabbitMQ in this model) would **consume messages** from the `prediction_requests` topic. It listens to the topic, retrieves the incoming prediction requests, and processes them.
- Once the AI service finishes processing the prediction (i.e., running the model inference), it **produces the result** to another Kafka topic, say `prediction_results`, which includes the `jobId` and the final prediction result.

### **3. Client Polling is Replaced with Kafka Consumer**

- **Current State**: The client short polls the AI service over HTTP to check if the prediction is ready.
- **With Kafka**: The client can now **subscribe** to the `prediction_results` topic as a Kafka consumer. Once the AI service finishes processing the prediction and publishes the result to `prediction_results`, the client receives it **in real-time**.
    - The client no longer needs to send repeated HTTP requests for polling. Instead, it waits for Kafka to push the result to it automatically.

### **Key Benefits of Using Kafka in This Setup:**

1. **Elimination of HTTP Short Polling**: Kafka's consumer model removes the need for short polling. The client simply subscribes to a Kafka topic and gets notified as soon as the result is ready.
2. **Decoupling**: Kafka helps to decouple the client service and the AI service. Neither needs to know about the internal workings of the other—they just read from and write to Kafka topics.
3. **Scalability**: Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput data streams. It can manage a massive volume of prediction requests and results, making it ideal for scaling up if needed.
4. **Real-Time Processing**: Kafka’s model allows for real-time message consumption. The AI service processes the message and the client is notified immediately once the result is published.
5. **Durability and Message Retention**: Kafka retains messages for a configurable period, so even if the client service temporarily goes down, it can still retrieve the result later without losing the message. This is particularly useful if there’s any downtime in the client service.
6. **Simplified System Architecture**: we no longer need HTTP for both requests and polling. we also remove Celery and RabbitMQ as task queueing systems, simplifying our architecture.

### **Proposed Kafka-Based Architecture**:

1. **Kafka Topic: `prediction_requests`**:
    - **Producer**: The client sends a prediction request (e.g., model inputs) to this topic.
    - **Consumer**: The AI service consumes these requests from the topic, processes them, and produces a prediction result.
2. **Kafka Topic: `prediction_results`**:
    - **Producer**: Once the AI service completes the prediction, it sends the result (including the `jobId`) to this topic.
    - **Consumer**: The client subscribes to this topic and listens for the result, matching the `jobId` with its request.

### **Detailed Workflow:**

1. **Client sends request**:
    - The client **produces a message** (with the model input and a `jobId`) to the Kafka topic `prediction_requests`.
    - Kafka brokers store this message in the `prediction_requests` topic.
2. **AI Service processes request**:
    - The AI service **consumes** the messages from the `prediction_requests` topic.
    - It processes the request (performs the inference) and generates the prediction.
    - After generating the prediction, it **produces a new message** with the `jobId` and the prediction result to the `prediction_results` topic.
3. **Client receives result**:
    - The client is a **consumer** of the `prediction_results` topic.
    - It listens to the topic and retrieves the prediction result once the AI service has published it.

### **How to Handle Different Scenarios**:

- **Multiple Consumers**: Kafka handles multiple consumers efficiently. If we have several client services (or AI services), Kafka’s partitioning model ensures messages are distributed properly.
- **Failure Scenarios**: If the client or AI service fails, Kafka's message retention ensures that messages are not lost. The AI service can pick up pending prediction requests from the `prediction_requests` topic when it recovers, and clients can retrieve prediction results that were published while they were down.
- **Message Ordering**: Kafka partitions can help maintain the order of messages within a partition. If message order is important (e.g., if prediction requests must be processed in sequence), we can configure Kafka to ensure the right order of processing.

### **Advantages and Trade-offs**:

### **Advantages**:

- **Asynchronous and Decoupled**: Kafka allows the client and AI service to be decoupled, making it easier to scale both independently.
- **Real-Time, Event-Driven**: The client gets results as soon as they’re ready without the need for inefficient polling.
- **Scalable and Reliable**: Kafka is designed to scale, and it provides durability with message retention. It’s a good choice if we expect growth or high throughput.

### **Potential Trade-offs**:

- **Increased Complexity**: Kafka can introduce complexity, especially in terms of managing brokers, topics, partitions, and consumers. If our current system is small or simple, Kafka might feel like over-engineering.
- **Operational Overhead**: Kafka requires robust monitoring and maintenance. Running Kafka clusters requires experience with distributed systems.
- **Latency**: If our AI service is highly real-time and latency-sensitive, Kafka introduces slightly more overhead compared to HTTP for very small tasks, but this is generally minimal.

### **Conclusion**:

This change will:

- Eliminate short polling.
- Allow us to implement an **event-driven, real-time architecture**.
- Scale more efficiently, handling high-throughput requests while maintaining fault tolerance and durability.

However, Kafka might add complexity and overhead, so it’s a good fit if our system needs high throughput, scalability, and real-time processing, or if we want to decouple services effectively. If we're operating at a smaller scale or prefer simplicity, the current setup might still suffice with some optimizations like WebSockets for polling.

# Design 3 (RMQ Only):

**RabbitMQ (RMQ)** can be used to handle the entire prediction request and response flow, and it can provide real-time capabilities as an alternative to Kafka. However, RabbitMQ is designed more as a message broker with different characteristics than Kafka, so the approach is a bit different but still capable of achieving the same functionality for real-time processing.

Here’s how we can structure the architecture using only **RabbitMQ**, and how it compares to Kafka in handling real-time interactions:

### **Proposed Architecture Using RabbitMQ**:

1. **Client Sends Request via RabbitMQ**:
    - Instead of sending HTTP requests, the client **publishes a message** (containing the prediction request and a `jobId`) to a RabbitMQ **queue** (or exchange).
    - This message would represent the prediction job that needs to be processed.
2. **AI Service Subscribes to RabbitMQ Queue**:
    - The AI service **consumes** the prediction requests from the RabbitMQ queue. It picks up messages from the queue as tasks to be processed (similar to how Celery works with RabbitMQ behind the scenes).
    - After processing the request (running the AI model), the AI service **publishes the result** to a **response queue** or directly back to the client.
3. **Client Receives Prediction Result via RabbitMQ**:
    - Instead of short polling over HTTP, the client **subscribes to a queue** or an **exchange** in RabbitMQ, waiting for the AI service to send the result.
    - Once the prediction result is ready, the AI service publishes the result to this queue, and the client consumes it as soon as it's available (real-time push-based communication).

### **Steps to Achieve Real-Time Messaging with RabbitMQ:**

### **1. Initial Request Submission (Prediction Request)**

- The client publishes a message to RabbitMQ, typically to a **direct** or **fanout exchange**. The exchange then routes the message to a queue where the AI service listens for tasks.
- This replaces the HTTP POST request. The client is effectively pushing a job into a queue managed by RabbitMQ.

### **2. AI Service Processes the Request**

- The AI service is a **consumer** of the queue containing the prediction requests. It consumes messages from this queue, processes the prediction task, and generates a result.
- After processing, the AI service needs to send the result back to the client. This can be done by either publishing to a **response queue** or using **RPC (Remote Procedure Call)** patterns in RabbitMQ.

### **3. Client Waits for the Response (Real-Time)**

- The client subscribes to a **response queue** or listens for the AI service to push the prediction result back via RabbitMQ. This is done in real-time, meaning that as soon as the AI service publishes the result, the client will receive the message immediately.
- This completely eliminates short polling, as the client gets the result as soon as it's available, making it real-time.

### **Patterns We Can Use with RabbitMQ for Real-Time Communication:**

### **Pattern 1: Pub/Sub Model**

- **Prediction Request**: Client publishes to an exchange (e.g., **direct** or **fanout**) that routes the message to a queue where the AI service listens for prediction jobs.
- **Prediction Result**: The AI service, after processing, publishes the result to another exchange/queue that the client is subscribed to.

This is a simple **publish-subscribe (pub/sub)** model where clients can receive messages in real-time.

### **Pattern 2: RPC (Remote Procedure Call) with RabbitMQ**

- RabbitMQ has a built-in pattern for **RPC**, which allows for request-response messaging. Here's how it works:
    - The client sends a request to a queue and specifies a **reply-to** queue and a **correlation ID**.
    - The AI service processes the message and sends the result back to the **reply-to** queue with the same correlation ID.
    - The client consumes the response from the **reply-to** queue, ensuring it matches the request based on the correlation ID.
    
    **How RPC eliminates polling**:
    
    - The client sends the request via RabbitMQ and waits for a response by subscribing to the reply-to queue. Once the AI service finishes the prediction, the response is pushed back to the client.
    - No polling is necessary—the client only receives the result once it's ready, providing real-time responses.

### **Pattern 3: Direct Message Routing**

- If we have multiple AI services or clients, RabbitMQ supports **routing keys** to send specific messages to specific queues or consumers. This way, we can implement fine-grained control over which AI service handles which requests, and the corresponding client receives the results.

### **Advantages of RabbitMQ for This Use Case**:

1. **Real-Time Communication**:
    - RabbitMQ supports **push-based notifications**, so the client doesn’t need to short-poll the AI service. The result is delivered in real-time as soon as the AI service processes the prediction.
2. **Simplicity**:
    - RabbitMQ is relatively easy to set up and manage for smaller-scale applications compared to Kafka. It doesn’t require the same level of operational complexity and is lighter-weight in some scenarios.
3. **Task Queuing + Messaging**:
    - RabbitMQ handles task queuing effectively (similar to how Celery works). Since it’s already widely used with Celery, we are leveraging its core strengths as a message broker for task distribution and messaging.
4. **Routing Flexibility**:
    - RabbitMQ has powerful message routing mechanisms (using exchanges, queues, and routing keys), allowing we to define how messages are distributed between services. This can be particularly useful if we have multiple AI models or different types of tasks that need to be handled.
5. **Lower Latency for Smaller Systems**:
    - For systems where low-latency, real-time messaging is critical but the scale is not extremely high (compared to Kafka's high-throughput systems), RabbitMQ is a great fit. It has lower latency in smaller environments.
6. **Durability and Reliability**:
    - RabbitMQ supports **message persistence** and **acknowledgements**, so even if the AI service or client service crashes, the messages won’t be lost. They can be retrieved once the services come back online.

### **Limitations and Considerations**:

- **Not Built for High Throughput**:
    - RabbitMQ is great for lower-latency real-time communication but isn’t as scalable as Kafka for extremely high-throughput systems. If we're processing millions of messages per second, RabbitMQ may not handle this as efficiently as Kafka.
- **Message Retention**:
    - RabbitMQ doesn’t retain messages like Kafka. Once a message is consumed, it’s gone unless we configure it to be persistent and manually manage requeuing. If we need to retain messages for auditing, retraining, or replaying predictions, Kafka would be more suited.
- **Complexity with Fanout/Routing for Large Systems**:
    - While RabbitMQ is great for routing messages in smaller systems, it can become more complex as the system grows. Managing exchanges, queues, and routing keys for large-scale systems with multiple consumers might introduce overhead.
- **No Built-in Message Replay**:
    - RabbitMQ doesn’t support Kafka-style message replay natively. If the client misses a message, we will have to handle the failure and requeue the message manually, whereas Kafka retains the message until we explicitly remove it.

### **Conclusion**:

RabbitMQ can handle real-time communication between our client and AI service as well, eliminating the need for HTTP and Celery. By utilizing **RabbitMQ's pub/sub model or RPC pattern**, we can build an event-driven architecture that provides real-time, push-based notifications for prediction results. This setup is suitable for systems that don’t require Kafka’s high-throughput capabilities but still need reliable, low-latency communication.

So, if our system doesn’t need Kafka’s scale and durability features but we want to avoid the overhead of HTTP and Celery, RabbitMQ can be a very effective alternative for real-time messaging.

# **Evaluation of RabbitMQ vs. Kafka:**

| **Aspect** | **RabbitMQ** | **Kafka** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Message Delivery** | Immediate delivery for smaller tasks | Streaming-based, better for large-scale delivery |
| **Push Updates** | Can easily integrate with WebSocket or SSE for real-time updates | Requires a more complex consumer setup but is possible with Kafka consumers |
| **Throughput** | Lower, not ideal for massive scaling | High throughput, designed for stream processing |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Requires additional configuration (mirrored queues) | Built-in fault tolerance and replication |
| **Message Replay** | Not built-in, messages are deleted after consumption unless manually persisted | Built-in message retention, can replay messages for retraining/audit |
| **Client Polling Overhead** | Can avoid short polling with WebSockets or real-time push-based communication | Can use Kafka consumers with event-based architecture to avoid polling entirely |
| **Operational Complexity** | Easier to manage, simpler to set up | More complex, requires management of brokers, topics, partitions, etc. |

### Why RMQ would be a better option than Kafka:

1. Maintenance of legacy applications that depend on Rabbit MQ
2. Staff training cost and steep learning curve required for implementing Kafka
3. Infrastructure cost for Kafka is higher than that for Rabbit MQ.
4. Troubleshooting problems in Kafka implementation is difficult when compared to that in Rabbit MQ implementation.
    - A Rabbit MQ Developer can easily maintain and support applications that use Rabbit MQ.
    - The same is not true with Kafka. Experience with just Kafka development is not sufficient to maintain and support applications that use Kafka. The support personnel require other skills like zoo-keeper, networking, disk storage too.

## Conclusion:

Personally I would prefer to go with options 3 due to its great message routing mechanism and low latency as well as supports built in **RPC** for req-reply process. However if the system is facing high loads, fast handling of massive prediction streamings throughput, **Kafka** would be a better approach indeed. For the final talks the followings are mentioned patterns (we've assumed that the Celery is removed):

- RMQ FanOut + WebSocket streaming (supports browser realtime communication, eliminates the shortpolling overhead)
- RMQ + RPC with Correlation Id (eliminates the need of shortpolling overhead)
- RMQ + RPC with Correlation Id + WebSocket streaming (supports browser realtime communication and eliminates the need of shortpolling overhead) ✅
- Kafka with WebSocket streaming (supports browser realtime communication, eliminates the shortpolling overhead)
- Kafka only (eliminates the need of shortpolling overhead, hight throughput but high latency)
