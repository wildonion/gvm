### Overview of the `StockPriceEvent()` method:

1. **Purpose**: The code is designed to monitor and manage the price of a stock in a concurrent environment using Rust. The goal is to update the stock's price in multiple threads while safely managing access to the shared resource (`Stock` instance) using a `Mutex` and a `Condvar`. The `Condvar` is used to block the main thread until the stock price reaches a specified limit.

### Key Components:

- **Mutex**: 
  - The `Mutex` is used to ensure that only one thread can access or modify the `Stock` instance at a time. This prevents data races and ensures safe concurrent access.

- **Condvar (Condition Variable)**: 
  - The `Condvar` is used to block the current thread (in this case, the main thread) until a certain condition is met. In this example, the condition is that the stock price reaches or exceeds a specified limit.

- **Threads**:
  - The code spawns 10 threads, each of which updates the stock price. After updating the price, each thread notifies the `Condvar`, indicating that the stock price has changed.

### How the Code Works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - A `Monitor` struct is created with an initial `Stock` instance. The `Stock` is wrapped in a `Mutex` to ensure thread-safe access.

2. **Updating the Price**:
   - The `update_price` method locks the `Stock` instance, updates its price, and then calls `notify_one` on the `Condvar`. This notifies any thread waiting on the `Condvar` that the stock price has changed.

3. **Blocking the Main Thread**:
   - The `wait_for_release` method locks the `Stock` instance and enters a loop where it checks if the stock price is below a certain limit (115.0 in this case). If the price is below the limit, the thread (in this case, the main thread) is blocked using `self.event_signal.wait(get_stock)`. The thread remains blocked until it receives a notification that the price has changed (via `notify_one` from `update_price`). This process repeats until the price reaches or exceeds the limit, at which point the main thread can proceed.

4. **Execution**:
   - The code spawns 10 threads, each updating the stock price. The main thread calls `wait_for_release`, which blocks until the stock price reaches or exceeds the limit. Once the limit is reached, the main thread continues and joins all the threads, ensuring they have completed execution.

### Clarifications and Corrections:

- **Blocking the Main Thread**:
  - Yes, the `wait_for_release` method blocks the main thread until the stock price reaches the specified limit. The blocking occurs because `wait_for_release` calls `self.event_signal.wait(get_stock)`, which puts the thread to sleep until it is notified by `update_price`.

- **Notification Process**:
  - The `notify_one` method in `update_price` is indeed responsible for waking up the blocked thread (the main thread in this case) to check the stock price again.

- **Thread Safety**:
  - The use of `Mutex` and `Condvar` ensures that the stock price is safely updated across multiple threads without data races. The `Mutex` ensures that only one thread can update the stock price at a time, and the `Condvar` ensures that the main thread is notified whenever the stock price changes.

### Final Explanation:

The code effectively monitors a stock price in a multi-threaded environment. The main thread is blocked (using a `Condvar`) until the stock price reaches a specified limit. The stock price is updated in 10 separate threads, each of which notifies the main thread whenever the price changes. Once the stock price reaches the limit, the main thread is unblocked, and the program proceeds to join all the threads, ensuring they have completed their execution.

### `std::sync::Mutex`
- **Blocking Behavior**: `std::sync::Mutex` is designed for use in a synchronous, blocking context. When a thread tries to lock a `std::sync::Mutex`, it will block the entire thread if the mutex is already locked by another thread. This means that the thread will be suspended until the mutex becomes available. In the context of a synchronous program, this is usually fine, but in an asynchronous context, it can cause significant problems.
  
- **Usage Context**: Typically used in multithreaded programs where threads are managed by the operating system (OS). Each thread is a heavy OS-level thread.

- **Performance in Async Context**: If you use `std::sync::Mutex` within an asynchronous context like Tokio, it can block the entire executor thread, potentially stalling other tasks scheduled on that thread, leading to performance issues and negating the benefits of asynchronous programming.

### `tokio::sync::Mutex`
- **Non-blocking Behavior**: `tokio::sync::Mutex`, on the other hand, is designed specifically for asynchronous contexts. When an asynchronous task tries to lock a `tokio::sync::Mutex`, and the mutex is already locked, the task is suspended rather than the thread. The Tokio runtime can then continue executing other tasks on that thread until the mutex becomes available. This ensures that other asynchronous tasks can make progress even if one task is waiting for a lock.

- **Usage Context**: This is specifically used within asynchronous programs where tasks are executed by an asynchronous runtime like Tokio. The tasks are lighter and are managed by the runtime, not the OS.

- **Performance in Async Context**: `tokio::sync::Mutex` avoids blocking the entire thread, allowing the Tokio runtime to remain responsive and efficiently schedule tasks.

### Summary of Differences:
- **Blocking vs. Non-blocking**: `std::sync::Mutex` blocks the entire thread and suspend the thread from executing other tasks, while `tokio::sync::Mutex` only suspends the task, allowing other tasks to continue executing inside the thread that the lock is called.
- **Context**: `std::sync::Mutex` is suited for synchronous contexts and OS-level threads, while `tokio::sync::Mutex` is designed for asynchronous contexts and task-based runtimes like Tokio.
- **Performance**: Using `std::sync::Mutex` in an async context can cause thread blocking and performance degradation, while `tokio::sync::Mutex` is optimized to work efficiently within the async task scheduling model.

In general, we shouldn't block the thread in async context at all hence using `std::sync::Mutex` in the context of an async task is wrong!

When you use `std::sync::Mutex` in Rust, if a thread tries to lock the mutex and the mutex is already locked by another thread, the following occurs:

1. **Blocking**: The calling thread is blocked. This means the thread stops executing and is put into a waiting state by the operating system (OS). The thread will not proceed with any other work until it successfully acquires the lock.

2. **Suspension**: The blocked thread is suspended by the OS. While suspended, the thread does not consume CPU resources, but it also cannot make any progress. The OS will wake up the thread once the mutex becomes available (i.e., when the lock is released by the thread that currently holds it).

3. **Context Switching**: The blocking causes a context switch in the OS, which is a relatively expensive operation because the OS must save the state of the blocked thread and possibly load the state of another thread to continue execution.

This behavior is suitable in a synchronous or multithreaded environment where the use of OS-level threads is the norm. However, in an asynchronous context, this blocking behavior can lead to inefficiencies, especially if the mutex is used frequently, because it can cause the entire thread (which might be running multiple async tasks) to be stalled.

### Key Points:
- **Blocking**: The thread that calls `lock()` will be blocked if the mutex is already locked.
- **Suspension**: The blocked thread is suspended by the OS until the mutex is unlocked.
- **Context Switching**: The OS may switch context to another thread, but the blocked thread remains inactive until the lock is available.

This contrasts with asynchronous mutexes like `tokio::sync::Mutex`, which are designed to avoid blocking the entire thread in an async environment. Instead, they suspend only the async task, allowing other tasks to continue running on the same thread.
