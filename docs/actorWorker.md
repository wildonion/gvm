Tasks can be represented as light threads, more of essence ligth threads can be more smarter objects like with isolated and no shared state mechanism with outside world cause they handle one message at a time and ensures internal state remains consistent while processing the message, they have a single thread of execution which enables them to execute jobs received by their jobq mailbox channel one at a time, each job however can be scheduled to be executed periodically or at an specific time. Putting all together creating a package that can execute tasks in ligh thread of executions or light threadpool without sacrificing resources, internal state sharing and syncing with mutex brings us something called Actor which can execute tasks one at a time in the actor runtime light threadpool by sending message to it.

### **1. Workers and Threads**:
A **worker** typically refers to an execution unit (or process) that handles jobs or tasks. Workers can be implemented using **threads** or **processes** depending on the underlying concurrency model.

- **Threads** are lightweight units of execution within a process. They share the same memory space, allowing for efficient data sharing but requiring synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks) to prevent race conditions.
  
- **Workers as Threads**: In many systems, workers are **threads** of execution, meaning each worker runs in its own thread and executes jobs concurrently. The runtime (like a thread pool) schedules the jobs to be executed by the threads. For example, in a typical **multithreading model** (e.g., in Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` or Java's `ExecutorService`), each worker thread picks up jobs and executes them.

---

### **2. Workers and Actors**:
In some systems, workers might be implemented as **actors** in the **actor model** of concurrency, which is different from the traditional thread-based model.

- **Actor Model**: In this model, an **actor** is an independent unit of computation that:
  - Has its own state and does not share memory with other actors.
  - Communicates with other actors by **sending messages**.
  - Processes one message at a time in isolation (single-threaded), which eliminates the need for explicit locking or synchronization.
  
- **Workers as Actors**: In actor-based systems (like **Akka** in Scala/Java or **Erlang**), workers are often considered **actors**. Each worker (actor) handles a job by processing a message it receives. The system schedules these actors, and they communicate via messages instead of shared memory, ensuring more scalable and fault-tolerant designs.

---

### **3. Workers Scheduled by Runtime**:
- **Runtime scheduling** typically refers to how the execution environment (e.g., a thread pool, actor system, or task scheduler) manages and schedules the execution of tasks or jobs by workers.

  - **For threads**: The operating system (OS) or a thread pool is responsible for scheduling threads based on the available resources (CPU, etc.). The runtime (like the JVM, Python interpreter, or Go runtime) will schedule worker threads to pick up jobs from a job queue and execute them.
  
  - **For actors**: In an actor-based system, the actor runtime (like Akka or Erlang's BEAM virtual machine) handles scheduling by dispatching messages to actors. Each actor processes one message at a time, ensuring no shared state and easier management of concurrency.

---

### **So, are workers threads or actors?**

- **Workers as threads**: In many traditional systems (e.g., web servers, thread pools, etc.), workers are implemented as **threads**, which execute jobs concurrently and share memory. The scheduling of these jobs is handled by the OS or runtime environment (like the JVM or Python runtime).
  
- **Workers as actors**: In an **actor-based concurrency model**, workers can be **actors**. Actors are single-threaded, independent units that process messages one at a time. They don't share memory and rely on message-passing for coordination.

### **Conclusion**:
- Workers can be **threads** in systems that use traditional thread-based concurrency.
- Workers can also be **actors** in systems that implement the actor model.
- The **runtime** schedules and manages the execution of these workers, whether they are threads or actors.

Both models are valid, and the choice depends on the concurrency model you're working with. If you're using an actor-based framework, workers are actors. In thread-based models, workers are threads (or sometimes processes in multiprocessing systems).

In the **actor model**, each actor handles **one message at a time** in its **single thread of execution**, which may seem counterintuitive in terms of speed, but it can still be **highly performant** due to several factors that make the actor model efficient for concurrent systems.

### **Why Actors Handling One Message at a Time Can Be Fast**:

#### 1. **No Locks or Synchronization Overhead**
- **Traditional multithreading** often requires shared state between threads, which leads to the need for locks, mutexes, or other synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions like channels. These synchronization mechanisms can cause bottlenecks, deadlocks, or contention, slowing down the system finally add some overheads.
  
- **Actor model advantage**: Since each actor processes one message at a time in isolation (without shared state), there's **no need for locks or synchronization**. This eliminates one of the major performance penalties in traditional multithreading environments. Actors don't block or wait on shared resources because each has its own state.

#### 2. **Message Passing and Asynchronous Execution**
- In the actor model, communication happens through **message passing**, and this is typically done **asynchronously**. When an actor sends a message to another actor, it doesn't wait for a response; it can continue processing other tasks or messages.
  
- **Non-blocking**: The actor's non-blocking nature ensures that the system isn't slowed down by waiting for results. Instead, actors can keep working on their own queue of messages, processing each one independently.

#### 3. **Efficient Use of System Resources (Event Loop)**
- In actor-based systems, the **actor runtime** (e.g., Akka, Erlang) often uses an **event loop** or a **lightweight threading model** (like **green threads** or **fibers**) to switch between actors efficiently.
  
- **Lightweight threads**: These are far cheaper in terms of CPU and memory resources compared to OS-level threads. The runtime can manage thousands or even millions of actors on a few physical threads, which enables the system to handle massive amounts of concurrency.

- **Example**: In Akka or Erlang, the runtime will multiplex actors over a small number of real threads (OS threads), but because actors don't block each other, the system remains highly efficient, processing many tasks concurrently even if each actor handles one message at a time.

#### 4. **Scalability and Distribution**
- The actor model is designed to **scale horizontally**. You can distribute actors across multiple machines or cores without worrying about shared memory or locks.
  
- **Distributed actors**: In a distributed system (e.g., with Akka or Erlang), actors can be placed on different nodes, allowing the system to handle a massive amount of work in parallel. The scalability allows the system to be highly performant even as the number of actors (and thus the number of tasks) grows.

#### 5. **Minimized Context Switching**
- **Traditional threads** (managed by the OS) involve **context switching**—saving the state of one thread and loading the state of another—when switching between tasks. This can introduce significant overhead, especially with a large number of threads.
  
- **Actor model advantage**: The actor runtime can manage many actors with minimal overhead since the actors are lightweight and don't require expensive context switching between tasks. In some systems (like Erlang's BEAM VM), the runtime is optimized to handle lightweight actors (or processes) efficiently, leading to very low-cost task switching.

#### 6. **Fine-Grained Concurrency**
- By processing one message at a time, each actor encapsulates its state, which simplifies reasoning about concurrency. In traditional systems, concurrency bugs are often hard to detect and fix because of shared state and race conditions.
  
- **Actor model advantage**: Since each actor processes only one message at a time, there's no risk of inconsistent state due to concurrent access. The **granularity of concurrency** in the actor model makes it easy to scale and maintain, reducing the overhead of debugging and error handling.

#### 7. **High Parallelism with Event-Driven Design**
- In event-driven systems, actors react to incoming messages as events, and they respond as quickly as they can. This makes the actor model **ideal for reactive, real-time systems** where tasks are relatively independent and can be broken down into smaller units of work.
  
- **Example**: In a system with thousands of independent users interacting with a service (e.g., a chat application), each user can be modeled as an actor. Since they don't need to share state directly, each user (actor) can process messages in parallel without locking or contention, which keeps the system responsive and fast.

### **Real-World Examples of Fast Actor-Based Systems**:

#### 1. **Erlang**
- Erlang is a classic example of how the actor model can be extremely performant. Erlang's **BEAM virtual machine** can handle **millions of lightweight processes** (actors) with low memory overhead. Erlang was built for telecommunications systems, where high concurrency, reliability, and low-latency performance are essential.
  
- **Telecom example**: Erlang has been used in systems that handle millions of simultaneous connections, such as phone switches or messaging systems, with actors processing each connection without blocking.

#### 2. **Akka (JVM-based)**
- **Akka** is an actor-based framework for building concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant applications on the JVM. It's used in high-throughput systems like **real-time analytics**, **IoT systems**, and **financial services**.
  
- **Parallel task execution**: Akka can spawn thousands or millions of actors that process independent tasks in parallel, making it an ideal choice for distributed systems that need high concurrency but want to avoid the complexities of traditional thread-based concurrency.

---

### **To Summarize: How Actors Handle One Message at a Time Efficiently**
- **No locking or contention**: By isolating state within each actor, there's no need for locks, which removes major bottlenecks found in traditional multithreading.
- **Asynchronous message passing**: Actors handle tasks asynchronously, enabling non-blocking execution and high concurrency.
- **Event-driven processing**: The event loop and lightweight thread model used in actor runtimes reduce context-switching overhead.
- **Scalability**: Actors can scale across multiple cores or machines, allowing them to process many messages in parallel.
- **Fine-grained concurrency**: Each actor processes one message at a time, simplifying concurrency management and allowing for high parallelism.

Even though each actor processes one message at a time, the overall system can handle a **massive number of concurrent tasks** efficiently, leveraging the lightweight nature of actors, message-passing concurrency, and non-blocking architecture. This makes actor-based systems **very fast and scalable**, particularly in distributed environments like blockchain smart contracts.

**Actix** is a powerful actor-based framework in **Rust** designed for building highly concurrent and asynchronous systems. It's particularly known for its efficiency, low overhead, and the ability to handle large amounts of tasks or connections concurrently, making it one of the fastest actor-based systems in existence:

---

### **1. Actix Actors**

In Actix, an **actor** is a fundamental unit of computation, just like in the actor model. Actors are isolated entities that manage their own state and communicate with each other via **message passing**.

- **Key Properties**:
  - **Encapsulated state**: Each actor has its own internal state that is not shared with other actors.
  - **Message handling**: Actors process incoming messages one at a time asynchronously.
  - **Concurrency model**: Actors are executed in **separate lightweight tasks** (similar to green threads or fibers), which are scheduled by the Rust async runtime (e.g., using **Tokio** or **async-std**).
  - **Lifecycle management**: Actix actors have lifecycle events, allowing you to handle initialization, suspension, and stopping logic in a structured way.

---

### **2. Messages in Actix**

Messages are the primary way actors communicate. In Actix, messages are **typed** and must implement the `Message` trait. Each message also has an associated response type, which allows actors to send replies to the sender.

- **Defining Messages**:
  ```rust
  use actix::prelude::*;

  struct MyMessage(String);

  impl Message for MyMessage {
      type Result = usize; // The result type of the message
  }
  ```

- **Sending Messages**: Actors communicate by sending messages to each other. In Actix, sending a message is **non-blocking** and happens asynchronously.
  ```rust
  actor_instance.do_send(MyMessage("Hello".into()));
  ```

- **Handling Messages**: Actors implement the `Handler` trait for each message type they want to handle.
  ```rust
  impl Handler<MyMessage> for MyActor {
      type Result = usize; // The result returned when the message is processed

      fn handle(&mut self, msg: MyMessage, _: &mut Self::Context) -> Self::Result {
          msg.0.len() // Return the length of the message string
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **3. Actix Context**

The **context** in Actix represents the actor's execution environment and lifecycle. The context is responsible for:
- **Managing the actor's lifecycle**: Starting, suspending, stopping, and restarting the actor.
- **Handling messages**: The context schedules messages for the actor to process, ensuring that messages are handled one at a time.
- **Timers and Intervals**: The context also allows actors to schedule timed events, such as delayed execution of a message or repeating intervals.

Each actor in Actix runs within a specific context type, and the most common one is `Context<Self>`, which is used for non-supervised actors.

---

### **4. Actor System in Actix**

The **actor system** in Actix is responsible for managing actors, handling message delivery, and ensuring actors are scheduled for execution. When you start an application, you first create the actor system, which sets up the runtime environment for actors to operate in.

- **Starting the Actor System**:
  ```rust
  #[actix_rt::main]
  async fn main() {
      let actor = MyActor.start(); // Starts the actor
      actor.do_send(MyMessage("Hello".into())); // Sends a message to the actor
  }
  ```

- **Supervision**: Actix supports actor supervision, where one actor (a supervisor) can monitor and restart child actors if they fail. This helps in building fault-tolerant systems.

---

### **5. Async and Concurrent Execution**

One of Actix's core strengths is that it integrates seamlessly with Rust's **async/await** ecosystem. This means you can write **asynchronous actors** that can perform non-blocking I/O operations, such as handling HTTP requests, database queries, or file operations without blocking the thread. Cause I/O won't block the threads they must get executed inside a light thread of execution while the thread is executing other tasks.

- **Async Message Handling**: Actix allows actors to perform asynchronous operations by using `async` functions inside message handlers.
  ```rust
  impl Handler<MyMessage> for MyActor {
      type Result = ResponseFuture<usize>;

      fn handle(&mut self, msg: MyMessage, _: &mut Self::Context) -> Self::Result {
          Box::pin(async move {
              // Perform async operations
              msg.0.len() // Example result: length of the string
          })
      }
  }
  ```

- **Concurrency**: Actix uses Rust's native async runtimes (e.g., **Tokio**) to provide **concurrency**. Multiple actors can execute concurrently, and since actors don't share memory and don't need locks, this avoids the complexity of traditional multithreaded programs.

---

### **6. Lightweight Execution with Minimal Overhead**

Actix actors are **lightweight**, similar to **green threads** or **fibers**. Each actor runs in its own lightweight task, which makes it possible to run **thousands or even millions** of actors concurrently on a single machine, depending on the available resources.

- **Thread Pool**: Actix operates on a pool of OS threads managed by the async runtime. It uses cooperative multitasking to ensure the system remains responsive, allowing lightweight tasks (actors) to execute concurrently without the overhead of context switching between threads.
  
- **No Global State**: Since actors don't share state (they pass messages to each other), there is no need for locking or synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or semaphores, reducing performance overhead.

---

### **7. Supervision and Fault Tolerance**

Actix follows the actor model's philosophy of **let it crash**. This means that if an actor encounters an unrecoverable error, it can be safely **restarted or stopped** by a supervising actor.

- **Supervision Tree**: You can set up actors in a **supervision tree**, where each supervisor monitors child actors. If a child actor crashes, the supervisor can restart it, ensuring the system remains robust and fault-tolerant.

  ```rust
  struct MySupervisor;

  impl Supervisor for MySupervisor {
      fn restarting(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context<MyActor>) {
          // Custom logic when the actor restarts
      }
  }
  ```

- **Error Handling**: Supervisors can define what happens when an actor fails, such as restarting the actor, logging the error, or escalating the failure to a higher-level supervisor.

---

### **8. Real-World Use Cases of Actix**

Actix is widely used in building **high-performance, low-latency systems** such as:
- **Web servers**: Actix Web, built on Actix, is one of the fastest web frameworks in Rust.
- **Microservices**: The actor model naturally lends itself to microservices architectures, where services are isolated and communicate asynchronously.
- **IoT and Real-Time Systems**: Actix's ability to handle large numbers of concurrent tasks makes it ideal for IoT systems that deal with massive data streams or event-driven architectures.

---

### **9. Comparison to Other Actor Models**
- **Erlang and Akka**: Both Erlang and Akka also implement actor models, but Actix is notable for being **extremely fast** due to Rust's zero-cost abstractions, memory safety guarantees, and native async support.
  
- **Efficiency in Actix**: Actix benefits from Rust's low-level control over memory and concurrency, providing **speed and safety** without garbage collection (like in Akka/Scala) or runtime VM overhead (like Erlang).

---

### **Summary of Key Concepts in Actix:**
1. **Actors**: Independent units that handle state and process messages asynchronously.
2. **Messages**: Typed communication between actors.
3. **Context**: Manages the actor's execution and message handling environment.
4. **Actor System**: Manages actors and their communication, scheduling, and lifecycle.
5. **Concurrency**: Non-blocking, asynchronous execution via Rust's async runtime.
6. **Lightweight Tasks**: Efficient use of system resources, enabling the creation of many actors with minimal overhead.
7. **Supervision**: Fault tolerance via supervisors that monitor and restart actors.
8. **Performance**: Actix is designed for high throughput and low latency, making it ideal for real-time and concurrent systems.

In the context of **actor-based systems** like **Actix** (or other actor frameworks), **actors** are lightweight entities that handle tasks by receiving and processing messages asynchronously. Here's a clearer explanation, tying together the concept of **lightweight threads** (or tasks) and how the **actor runtime** manages their scheduling:

### **Actors as Lightweight Tasks (or Threads)**
- **Actors** can be thought of as **lightweight tasks** or **green threads** that are scheduled by the **actor runtime**. They are **not full-fledged OS threads** (which can be more resource-heavy and involve expensive context switches), but instead are smaller, more efficient units of execution.
  
- These **lightweight tasks** (sometimes called **fibers** or **coroutines**) are more resource-efficient than OS threads because they run within a single or few OS threads, multiplexing many actors over a small number of system threads. This allows a large number of actors to run concurrently.

- **Actix** uses **async/await** in Rust, allowing it to leverage Rust's async runtime (e.g., **Tokio** or **async-std**) for scheduling these lightweight tasks. This means that many actors can be created and run concurrently, making it possible to efficiently scale the system while keeping the resource footprint low.

### **Actor Runtime and Task Scheduling**
- The **actor runtime** (like the Actix system) is responsible for **scheduling and managing the execution of actors**. The actor runtime handles several important tasks:
  1. **Message Delivery**: Actors communicate by sending messages to each other. The actor runtime ensures that messages are delivered to the correct actor.
  2. **Task Scheduling**: Each actor processes one message at a time in its own **single-threaded context**. The runtime schedules when an actor should wake up and process the next message in its queue. This is done without blocking other actors, thanks to the non-blocking and asynchronous nature of the actor model.
  3. **Multiplexing Actors**: The runtime efficiently multiplexes many actors over a few OS threads. This way, a single physical thread can handle the work of hundreds or even thousands of actors, switching between actors when they are ready to process the next message.
  4. **Concurrency Without Shared State**: Since actors don’t share memory and each actor processes messages one at a time, there’s no need for locks or synchronization mechanisms (like mutexes). The runtime manages message queues for each actor, ensuring messages are processed in the correct order.

### **Message Passing and Asynchronous Execution**
- In actor systems, the **messages** that actors send to each other are how work is distributed. Instead of directly calling functions or manipulating shared state, actors interact by **passing messages**. The runtime ensures that each actor processes its incoming messages **asynchronously**.
  
- **Non-blocking execution**: When an actor receives a message, it can process it in a non-blocking way (using `async/await` in Rust). This means the actor doesn’t have to wait for long-running tasks to complete (such as I/O operations), allowing the runtime to switch to another actor and keep the system responsive.

### **Actors as Single-Threaded Execution Units**
- **Single-threaded execution**: Each actor processes **only one message at a time**. This may seem like a limitation, but it is a deliberate design choice that simplifies concurrency. Since the actor can only process one message at a time, there’s no risk of race conditions within the actor itself. It ensures that all internal state remains consistent while processing a message.
  
- The runtime efficiently switches between actors when they have messages to process, ensuring high concurrency and throughput.

---

### **Putting It All Together**
In **Actix** (and actor systems in general):
- **Actors** are lightweight tasks that are not full OS threads, but instead **lightweight units of execution** that run within the context of a few OS threads.
- The **actor runtime** schedules these tasks (actors) by:
  1. Handling **message delivery**.
  2. Scheduling the actors for execution **asynchronously** when they receive messages.
  3. Ensuring that actors process **one message at a time** (single-threaded), which avoids the need for locks or synchronization.
  4. **Multiplexing** a large number of actors over a small number of OS threads, making the system **scalable and efficient**.
  
This design ensures that the system can handle **high concurrency and low-latency** workloads while keeping resource consumption low and simplifying concurrency management.

---

### **Example of Actix Actor Lifecycle and Message Handling**

```rust
use actix::prelude::*;

// Define an actor
struct MyActor;

impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}

// Define a message
#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "usize")]
struct MyMessage(String);

// Implement message handler
impl Handler<MyMessage> for MyActor {
    type Result = usize;

    fn handle(&mut self, msg: MyMessage, _: &mut Self::Context) -> Self::Result {
        println!("Received message: {}", msg.0);
        msg.0.len() // Return the length of the message string
    }
}

#[actix_rt::main]
async fn main() {
    // Start an instance of the actor
    let actor = MyActor.start();

    // Send a message asynchronously
    let result = actor.send(MyMessage("Hello, Actix!".to_string())).await;

    // Output the result (length of the message string)
    match result {
        Ok(res) => println!("Message length: {}", res),
        Err(err) => println!("Error handling message: {:?}", err),
    }
}
```

### **Key Concepts in the Example**:
- The `MyActor` actor processes **one message at a time** (each message of type `MyMessage`).
- The actor’s runtime manages the **scheduling of tasks** and the **delivery of messages**.
- The message is processed **asynchronously**, without blocking, allowing other actors to work concurrently.
  
---

### **Summary**
- **Actors** in Actix are **lightweight tasks** that are scheduled by the **actor runtime** to process messages.
- The actor runtime **schedules these tasks** efficiently over a pool of OS threads, ensuring high concurrency with minimal resource usage.
- Since actors are **single-threaded**, they process **one message at a time**, which ensures consistency and simplifies concurrency management.
- This model allows Actix to handle **large-scale concurrent systems** efficiently, using Rust's powerful async capabilities for non-blocking execution.
